## Abstract
On the path towards decarbonisation of the steel industry, the use of H2/NG blends in furnaces, where high temperatures are needed, is one of the alternatives that needs to be carefully studied. The present paper shows the CFD study carried out for a full-scale reheating furnace burner case. The real operating conditions as well as experimental measurements provided by the furnace operator were used to validate the results and reduce simulation uncertainties. The burner under consideration (2.5 MW) works in flameless mode with natural gas and preheated air (813 K). Starting from this point, another three fuel blends with volumetric percentages of 23% (also known as G222), 50% and 75% of H2 in natural gas were considered. For this purpose, the open source CFD code OpenFOAM was used, where the novel NE-EDC turbulence-chemistry interaction model was implemented, which has already been successfully validated specifically for flameless combustion in a furnace. The implementation incorporated an enhanced approach for calculating the chemical time-scale, coupled with a specific post-processing solver to predict NOx emissions. The study analyses the relative impact of the considered fuel blends on NOx formation and flameless regime. The modelling results demonstrated the burner’s capability to operate efficiently with high concentrations of hydrogen, maintaining flameless regime in all cases. This condition ensured uniform temperature distributions and low levels of NO emissions, reaching a maximum value of 86 mg/m. These results indicated the proper functionality of the existing natural gas-based burner with H/NG blends, which was the primary requirement for the conversion process.

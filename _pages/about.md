I obtained my PhD degree in Engineering Physics at the University of the Basque Country in 2021, an activity I carried out at the R&D centre Ikerlan. My research field focused on the CFD modelling of hydrogen combustion systems and thermal NOx emissions in laminar and turbulent flames. I am currently working as researcher at the Basque Centre for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) as a member of the knowledge-transfer unit. My work focuses on solving complex flows that can be addressed by computational fluid dynamics, both for applied research projects with industrial companies as well as for basic research projects. The research branches I am interested in are related to the modelling of combustion processes and chemical reactions together with heat transfer. I am also interested in the fields of hydrodynamics and multiphase flows applied to marine energy, which I have already worked with.

<p align="justify">
I obtained my PhD degree in Engineering Physics at the University of the Basque Country in 2021, an activity I carried out at the R&D centre Ikerlan. My research field focused on the CFD modelling of hydrogen combustion systems and thermal NOx emissions in laminar and turbulent flames. I continued my research career at the Basque Centre for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) as a member of the knowledge-transfer unit. My work focused on solving complex flows that can be addressed by computational fluid dynamics, both for applied research projects with industrial companies as well as for basic research projects. Currently, I'm a Lecturer within the Energy Engineering Department at UPV/EHU, specializing in the field of Fluid Mechanics. In this capacity, I manage the roles of teaching subjects within my area of expertise and actively driving forward my research on CFD simulation of reactive flows applied to industrial combustion systems and the development of novel combustion models.
